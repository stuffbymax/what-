Physical Systems Requirement: The Software can only be executed on systems that run Linux, BSD, or other open-source Unix-like operating systems as the primary operating system on bare metal (physical hardware). Users of Arch Linux may modify or develop the Software only on these physical systems.

Arch Linux Verification: Any individual or entity wishing to modify the Software must verify that they are running Arch Linux on their system at the time of modification. Verification may include, but is not limited to:
- Running the `uname -a` command to display system information.
- Demonstrating the presence of the `pacman` package manager, which is typically used on Arch Linux.
